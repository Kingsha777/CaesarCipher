Here's a step-by-step guide on how to run the Caesar Cipher tool:

1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website.
2. Create a Python Script
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad++, VS Code, Sublime Text) and create a new file.
Copy and paste the Caesar Cipher code (including the banner) into this file.
Save the file with a .py extension, e.g., caesar_cipher.py.
3. Run the Script
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your Python script is saved using the cd command. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/script
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python caesar_cipher.py
This will execute the script and display the banner with "CAESAR CIPHER" at the top.
4. Input Text and Shift Value
After the banner is displayed, the program will prompt you to enter the text you want to encrypt. Type your text and press Enter.
Next, the program will ask for a shift value (an integer). Enter the number of positions you want each letter to shift in the alphabet and press Enter.
5. View the Encrypted and Decrypted Text
The program will then display the original (plaintext) text, the encrypted text, and the decrypted text.
The output will look something like this:
vbnet
Copy code
Enter the text to be encrypted: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3

Plaintext: Hello, World!
Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted: Hello, World!
6. Modify or Re-run
If you want to encrypt another message, simply run the script again.
You can modify the script to try different inputs, adjust the banner, or customize the encryption and decryption process.
This Caesar Cipher tool is a basic implementation and serves as a great way to understand how simple encryption works.
